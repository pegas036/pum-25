    "## *Training PyTorch models on GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPUs are optimized for performing matrix operations in parallel.** Although we call them \"graphics processing units\", they are actually very powerful processors that can be used for any kind of parallel computation, including training deep neural networks. In fact, data science is one of the most common applications of GPUs today, as can be seen by the revenue of companies like NVIDIA over the past few years. NVIDIA is a monopolist in the GPU market - in 2023, the company owned 92% of the data center GPU market share. As for 31 July, the 2024 revenue of NVIDIA was 60.92 billion USD, while the total revenue of 2020 was $10.92 billion. If someone benefits from the deep learning hype, it is certainly NVIDIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you happen to have an NVIDIA GPU in your computer, you can use it to train your deep learning models, as PyTorch has support for CUDA, which is NVIDIA's parallel computing API. To train a model on GPU, you need to explicitly tell PyTorch to move the model and the data to the GPU.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\n",
    "# Check if a GPU is available\n",

    "# Initialize the model and move it to the GPU\n",
    "model = SomeNeuralNetwork().to(device)   # Move the model to the GPU\n",

    "        X, y = batch\n",
    "        X, y = X.to(device), y.to(device)   # Move the tensors to GPU\n",
    "        \n",
    "        y_pred = model(X)   # Perform a forward pass (on the GPU)\n",
    "        loss = criterion(y_pred, y)   # Compute the loss (still on the GPU)\n",

    "        # to do anything else with them\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **the model and all the tensors it uses for computation should be moved to the GPU**. You can do this by calling the `.to(device)` method on the model and the data tensors. If you want to move the data back to the CPU (to process it further, calculate metrics, visualize), you call the `.cpu()` method on the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Doing calculations on the GPU, you should be wary of few things:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The GPU has a limited amount of memory**, so you should be careful not to run out of memory. A typical graphics card has a few gigabytes of memory, so you should be fine with most models and datasets. However, moving very large tensors to the GPU can cause out-of-memory errors. That's one of the reasons why we use a dataloader and process the data in batches.\n",
    "* While the GPU is much faster than the CPU for large matrix operations, **transferring data between the CPU and the GPU is slow**. Therefore, it is best to minimize the number of data transfers between the CPU and the GPU."

    "## *Exercise: Easy hyperparameter tuning with wandb\n",
    "\n",
    "Wandb allows you to perform hyperparameter tuning by automatically creating multiple runs with different hyperparameters and logging the performance of each run. Below is a brief instruction to `wandb` hyperparameter tuning, but you are more than welcome to find more information in the [official wandb guide](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use wandb to perform hyperparameter tuning of the neural network, trying different values of the learning rate, batch size, and the size of the hidden layers. You can use the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to define a dictionary with the hyperparameters that we want to tune. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parameters = {\n",
    "    'learning_rate': {'values': [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]},\n",
    "    'batch_size': {'values': [32, 64, 128]},\n",
    "    'layer_1_size': {'values': [64, 128, 256]},\n",
    "    'layer_2_size': {'values': [32, 64, 128]}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to create a dictionary with the configuration of the run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sweep_config = {\n",
    "    'name': 'mnist-sweep',\n",
    "    'method': 'grid',   # grid search, you can also try 'random' or 'bayes'\n",
    "    'metric': {'goal': 'minimize', 'name': 'val_loss'},\n",
    "    'parameters': parameters,   # that's the dictionary with the hyperparameters\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the `wandb.sweep` function to perform hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config, project='mnist-classifier')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we can finally run the sweep:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `train` is a function that trains the model and logs the metrics to wandb. This function should take a `config` argument, which will contain the hyperparameters of the run. That is how wandb knows which hyperparameters to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rewrite the training loop into a function that takes a single dictionary `parameters` as an argument, initializes the model, optimizer, and criterion, and trains the model for a fixed number of epochs. The function should log the loss and accuracy of the training and validation sets to wandb.\n",
    "2. Create a dictionary with the hyperparameters that you want to tune.\n",
    "3. Create a sweep configuration dictionary.\n",
    "4. Run the sweep and monitor the results in the wandb dashboard."
