    "**Standardization** of datasets is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators implemented in scikit-learn. If some features of our data have very different scales (for example, one feature is in the range $[0, 1]$ and another can potentially be any positive number), some models might consider the feature with larger numerical values to be more important. This can be a problem, as we want our model to be able to learn from all features equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization transform our data in such a way that its distribution will have a mean value $\\mu = 0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 1$. We can achieve this by using the `StandardScaler` from the `sklearn` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common preprocessing step is **normalization**. In this case, the data is scaled to a fixed range, usually $[0, 1]$. The motivation to use this scaling method includes preserving zeros in sparse data. For example, when making predictions about the expected outcome of an anticancer therapy, the value of $0$ observed tumors in a patient is probably much more informative for the predictive model than any other number of observed tumors alone. We can scale data to a certain range by using the `MinMaxScaler` from the `sklearn` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about those two feature scaling methods in the [Scikit-learn preprocessing docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).\n",

    "**Remember that the scaler should be fitted only on the training set, and then used to transform both the training and test sets.** If we first transform the entire dataset and then split it into training and test sets, we are leaking the information about **test set data distribution** to the model, which would lead to overly optimistic results.\n",

    "All the data manipulations, including the generation of features (molecular descriptors) and scaling we did completely by hand. As the project grows, this approach becomes unmanageable and error-prone. We could hide all these data preprocessing steps inside a class, so that we can reuse it easily whenever we need to extract features from a list of SMILES strings.\n",

In this fashion, our featurizer will be able to take a list of SMILES strings and return a dataframe with the molecular descriptors, ready to be used in any regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Featurizer` class should implement the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__init__(self, smiles_list)`\n",

    "    * Store a `StandardScaler` object as an attribute of the class.\n",
    "    * Take an array of **training set** SMILES strings as input and calculate molecular descriptors for each molecule.\n",
    "    * Fit the scaler to the calculated descriptors of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `get_descriptors(self, smiles_list)`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This method should take an array of SMILES strings as input and return a dataframe with the molecular descriptors calculated with RDKit. You can reuse the `get_descriptors` function defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `featurize(self, smiles_list)`\n",
    "    \n",

What we can (and will) do is employ a **search algorithm** to find the best hyperparameters automatically. This piece of code will try different hyperparameters and return the best combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time we introduced the concept of a **validation set**, which is a subset of the training set used to evaluate the model's performance during hyperparameter tuning. To tune the hyperparameters of a classifier model we cut out a part of the training set and used the accuracy on this validation set as a metric to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, when tuning hyperparameters of a machine learning model, we do not usually create a single validation set. Instead, we employ a srategy called **cross-validation**. In $k$-fold cross-validation, the process of training and evaluating the model is repeated $k$ times, with each repetition using a different validation set. Thanks to this strategy, each data point present in the original training set will have the chance to be included in a validation sets. The metrics reported from $k$ folds are then averaged to get a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n",

    "Luckily, we do not have to implement this algorithm ourselves, as scikit-learn provides a `GridSearchCV` class that can help us with this task. It performs an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid and evaluates the model's performance using $k$-fold cross-validation. By default, `GridSearchCV` uses a 5-fold cross-validation, which is a common choice for $k$."

    "**Some important functions you may need to use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `st.title` sets the title of the app\n",
    "- `st.write` writes text to the app (supports [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) synthax for text formatting)\n",
    "- `st.dataframe` displays a dataframe\n",
    "- `st.latex` renders LaTeX code (for mathematical formulas)\n",
    "- `st.text_input` creates a text input field (for multiline inputs, use `st.text_area`)\n",
    "- `st.button` creates a button (you can use it to trigger some action)\n",

    "    streamlit run data/streamlit/app.py\n",

    "## Exercise 5: Build an app for solubility prediction (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is a continuation of the previous one. We will use all the code we have written so far to build a simple web app that predicts the solubility of molecules. The app will run in the browser and allow the user to input one or more SMILES strings, and will display the predicted solubility of the molecules.\n",
    "The [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library) will be very helpful in this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The app should have the following structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A title and a short description of what the app does.\n",
    "2. A text area where the user can input a SMILES string (or multiple SMILES strings in a column).\n",
    "3. A button to submit the input.\n",
    "4. A section that displays the predicted solubility of the molecule(s) as a table of SMILES strings and their corresponding solubility values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app should use our `Featurizer` class to extract the features from the input SMILES strings and predict the solubility using the trained `svm` regressor. **The model and the featurizer should not be trained inside the app, but loaded from a `.pkl` file instead!** Thanks to this approach, we will not need the training data to run the app, and the app will start much faster, as it will not need to retrain the model every time."
